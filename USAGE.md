# Usage

Thank you for installing this product. Here goes a quick, universal guide for all programs made by Commands-Collection team.

## Launch a shell with Commands-Collection in `PATH`

Make sure you enable "Install Start Menu/Desktop/Task bar shortcuts" option first.

Then, using any way you please, open CommandsCollection. A CMD window will open, telling you that `%PATH%` has been updated.

That's what you will do on Windows.

## Arguments and flags

Flags sets different stuff of the program.

* Short flags begin with `-`, following by a character.
* Long flags begin with `--`.

For most programs, `-h` / `--help` are available.
They show all available flags and more informations.

You can combine short flags like this:

```bash
dir -la
```

With that `dir` will show all files and folders as you wish.

Pass values to long flags like this:

```bash
env --get=HOMEPATH
```

**Not only** this:

```bash
env --get HOMEPATH
```
