# Usage

Thank you for installing this product. Here goes a quick, universal guide for all programs made by Commands-Collection team.

## Arguments and flags

Flags sets different stuff of the program.

* Short flags begin with `-`, following by a character.
* Long flags begin with `--`.

For all programs, `-h` / `--help` are available.
They show all available flags and more informations.

`-V` and `--version` are also available for project/program version.

From now on, short flags will be referred in most documents.

<details>
<summary>Q: Can I be a r/masterhacker with these?</summary>
<details>
<summary>A: No.</summary>

(for those who don't know: r/masterhacker is a subreddit that is NOT
 about any **actual** hacking stuff, it instead shows pictures of kids
 running `sudo apt update` and say that "Hey, I'm a hacker now". This
 project does NOT provide any hacking tools, nor going to help that.)

<details>
<summary>Q: Can I run this on X platform?</summary>

A: Depends. While we make build script(s) that allows you to build Commands-Collection
for your desired platform (supported ones can be seen at the very top of [Makefile](Makefile)),
there is no gurantee that all commands work well on all platforms.
